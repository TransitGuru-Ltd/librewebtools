INSTALLING LibreWebTools
========================

Here are a few simple steps for installing LibreWebTools

 0. In the examples, I am assuming your webroot is /var/www/librewebtools/, so 
    make sure to replace this with the actual webroot where you install your
    files. All paths are relative to the webroot. I am also assuming that you
    set up your apache virtual hosts using the file in examples/apache.conf 
    (which is a very basic set-up, but make sure have AllowOverride All enabled
    for your directory as this site relies on .htaccess files.
    
 1. Edit your includes/classes/settings.php to your desired database
    user and password settings. Make sure you use a different password than the
    one given in the default file.
    
 2. Navigate to your website using your web browser. It will do a few checks
    and it is determined that the database is not installed, a form will appear
    to collect basic information to build your database based on the 
    instructions in the includes/classes/settings.php and your form
    data regarding the administrative website user.
