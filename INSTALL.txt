INSTALLING LibreWebTools
========================

Here are a few simple steps for installing LibreWebTools

 0. Please note that these instructions are subject to change as this toolset
    is the result of about 12 hours of work combining code from various
    projects and making them into a toolset. See the RELEASE.txt file for 
    release notes.
    
 1. In the examples, I am assuming your webroot is /var/www/librewebtools/, so 
    make sure to replace this with the actual webroot where you install your
    files. All paths are relative to the webroot. I am also assuming that you
    set up your apache virtual hosts using the file in examples/apache.conf 
    (which is a very basic set-up, but make sure have AllowOverride All enabled
    for your directory as this site relies on .htaccess files.
    
 2. Edit the file in includes/sql/database.sql to your specifications, 
    especially paying attention to changing the password. DO NOT USE the default
    password on a production system!
    
 3. Change directory to your webroot, then type the following commands in your
    commandline (assuming you keep database name as librewebtools),
    
    cd includes/sql
    mysql -u root -p < database.sql
    
 4. Type the following commands in your command line, replacing 'librewebtools'
    with the database name that you entered in line 14 in database.sql
    
    mysql -u root -p librewebtools < core.sql
    mysql -u root -p librewebtools < data.sql
    
 5. Visit your website and Set up your administrative account when it prompts
    you to do so. Once that is set up, you are on your way to using the site.
