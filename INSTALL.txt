INSTALLING LibreWebTools
========================

Here are a few simple steps for installing LibreWebTools

 0. Please note that these instructions are subject to change as this toolset
    is the result of about 12 hours of work combining code from various
    projects and making them into a toolset. See the RELEASE.txt file for 
    release notes.
    
 1. In the examples, I am assuming your webroot is /var/www/librewebtools/, so 
    make sure to replace this with the actual webroot where you install your
    files. All paths are relative to the webroot. I am also assuming that you
    set up your apache virtual hosts using the file in examples/apache.conf 
    (which is a very basic set-up, but make sure have AllowOverride All enabled
    for your directory as this site relies on .htaccess files.
    
 2. Edit the file in INCLUDES/sql/database.sql to your specifications, 
    especially paying attention to changing the password. DO NOT USE the default
    password on a production system!
    
 3. Change directory to your webroot, then type the following commands in your
    commandline (assuming you keep database name as librewebtools),
    
    cd /var/www/librewebtools/INCLUDES/sql
    mysql -u root -p < database.sql
    
 4. Type the following commands in your command line, replacing 'librewebtools'
    with the database name that you entered in line 14 in database.sql
    
    cd /var/www/librewebtools/INCLUDES/sql
    mysql -u root -p librewebtools < schema.sql
    mysql -u root -p librewebtools < content.sql
    
 5. Replace values in INCLUDES/modules/core/settings.inc.php to match the
    changes made in INCLUDES/sql/database.sql
    
 6. Change file permissions to the FILES directory to ensure the application
    will be able to add files and folders
    
    cd /var/www/librewebtools/
    sudo chown www-data FILES
    
 7. Visit your website and log in as the username admin with password Admin. 
    Make sure to go to Account > Password and change your password. Once that 
    is set up, you are on your way to using the site.
