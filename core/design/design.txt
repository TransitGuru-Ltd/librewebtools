DESIGN NOTES

The goal of this file is to provide a rough design of how LWT will operate, 
and thus guide how other modules can be designed around it. For maximum 
flexibility, the goal is to separate parts of the site into individual 
components, as described below.

* pages: URL mapping for content/applications
* content: The stuff that is shown to the public
  * copy: Textual content with MINIMAL markup
  * files: Binary attachments that are served alongside textual content
  * terms: Means to apply tags to content hierarchical
  * revisions: Means to version control the content
* layout: Determines how the site/pages are put together
  * areas: Portions of the site that are populated within each theme
  * menus: Auto or semi-auto generated menus
* themes: Design rules to make the content/templates look good
  * style: Styling rules in the CSS
  * templates: Govern the overall layout of the site
* settings: General site settings
* modules: Add-on functionality that can be enabled or disabled
  * bootstrap: File or function that bootstraps the module (if applicable)
  * php: PHP code used as includes
  * js: Javascript code added for the particular module
* access: Rules for permissions and users
  * users: Users, groups, roles
  * permissions: access permissions to certain areas of the site
